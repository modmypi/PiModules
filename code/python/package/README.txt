PiModules Python Package
========================

This directory contains the installation scripts and the PiModules(R) Python package that supports PiModules products.

Installation
------------

First you need to install a couple of Python dependencies.  Install python3-pip like this:

	sudo apt-get install python3-pip

Then install both `jinja2` and `xmltodict` like this:

	sudo pip3 install jinja2
	sudo pip3 install xmltodict

Both of the above libraries are used in the sending of email alerts by the file-safe shutdown
daemon.

Now install the pimodules package:

	sudo python3 setup.py install

You can record what files are installed by the above process by running it like this:

	sudo python3 setup.py install --record <filename>

Where <filename> will be a text file containing one line per file installed by the process.

If the `--record` function was used, files can be easily uninstalled in this way:

	cat <filename> | xargs sudo rm

Where `<filename>` was the name of the file recorded in the installation process.
